# Deep Work - Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World by Cal Newport
Overall a good book, no mind blowing revelations but generally good rules and I think in the modern world many people, my self included, could use the reminder and guidance on this. I had multiple takeaways here that I am turning into actionable behavior changes.

## Part 1
* Lots of explanation and examples about why deep work is rare these days, still immensely vauable, what it is, etc.
* Didn't really find any actionable advice here but good to read nonetheless

## Part 2
### Work Deeply
* choose one of the 4 strategies (rhythmic approach for me)
* Determine your rules (no phone nearby when working), supporting behaviors (i.e. wear headphones, turn on a desk lamp to indicate to yourself that you are working)
* Look for opportunities to make a "grand gesture" commitment to deep work (go to the library for a few hours, rent a coworking space, go to a park or a cafe, etc)
* Don't be afraid to collaborate and don't use deep work as an excuse to avoid people or collaboration. But also don't let collaboration become a distraction and get in the way of deep work
* Act on lead measures (number of hours of deep work) rather than lag measures (performance review for the quarter)
* Keep a scoreboard (track your lead measure, i.e. tally of deep work hours)
* Have frequent checkins with yourself (weekly)
### Embrace Boredom
* Your brain will crave distraction if that's what it's used to. Don't let your brain rely on cheap entertainment.  When you do want cheap entertainment, plan it in advance and make yourself wait a bit so your brain doesn't associate the impulse for cheap entertainment with immediately gratifying that desire.
* Boredom gives you a chance to think
* Constant distraction impacts your ability to work deeply when you need to
### Quit social media
* Pretty straightforward common reasons to quit, no surprises here
* Main takeaway is identify when and how social media is useful to you and only use it deliberately in that manner. One useful aspect to social media doesn't mean it is useful enough overall to justify it. The positives should outweigh the negatives and the positives on their own should be impactful.
* For example, let's say Facebook has the positive of entertainment but that doesn't outweight the distraction factor. Or let's say that Facebook has no negatives, and a minor upside of being able to use Facebook marketplace to buy and sell. But ultimately you decide that that is not a priority for you so it is not worth it.
### Drain the shallows
* Schedule your whole day in blocks
* When you finish your work for the day, shut it down entirely. Give yourself a chance to rest and recover so that you can return to your deep work the next day with your best foot forward
